# ÖV-Güteklassen


The Public Transport Quality Classes <i>(German: ÖV-Güteklassen)</i> show the **attractiveness of public transport services** for a selected area.

## 1. Explanation

Public Transport Quality Classes, also known as **ÖV-Güteklassen**, are a classification system used to evaluate and categorize the **quality** of public transport services in a given area. The concept is used to plan and evaluate public transport services to ensure that they meet certain standards and effectively serve the needs of the population. The quality classes thereby range from **<span style={{color: "#199741"}}>A</span>** (very good offer) to **<span style={{color: "#E4696A"}}>F</span>** (very poor offer).

:::info 
The calculation of the public transport quality classes is only available for areas where the transport network is integrated into GOAT.

## 2. Example use cases

- How good is public transport supply in different parts of the city?
- How many people are underserved by public transport? Where is the need for further supply?
- How does the quality of public transport services differ at different times of the week and day?

## 3. How to use the indicator?

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">1</div>
  <div class="content">Click on <code>Toolbox</code> <img src={thematicIcon} alt="toolbox" style={{width: "25px"}}/>. </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">2</div>
  <div class="content">Under the <code>Accessibility Indicators</code> menu, click on <code>ÖV-Güteklassen</code>. This opens the settings menu.</div>
</div>

### Calculation Time

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">3</div>
  <div class="content">Define the <code>Day</code>, <code>Start Time</code> and <code>End Time</code>, for which you like to perform the analysis.</div>
</div>

### Reference Layer

  <div class="step-number">4</div>
  <div class="content">Select the <code>Reference Layer</code> for which you like to calculate the indicator. This can be any polygon feature layer.</div>
</div>

### Configuration

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">5</div>
  <div class="content">Select the <code>Catchment area type</code> for the calculation, which can be based on either <code>Buffer</code> or <code>Network</code>. </div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">6</div>
  <div class="content">Click on <code>Run</code>. This starts the calculation of the Public Transport Quality Classes for the selected area.</div>
</div>

:::tip Hint

Depending on the size of the selected area, the calculation might take some minutes. The [status bar](../../workspace/home#status-bar) shows the current progress.

### Results

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">7</div>
  <div class="content">As soon as the calculation process is finished, the resulting layers will be added to the map. The results consist of one layer called <b>"ÖV-Güteklassen"</b>, showing the Public Transport Quality Classes, and one layer called <b>"ÖV-Güteklassen Stations"</b> which provides all stations that were used for the calculation of this indicator. The station points that are visualized in grey have a service frequency that is too low and thus do not contribute to any public transport quality class.
  <p></p>
  If you click on an "ÖV-Güteklassen" item on the map, you will see further details such as its pt_class and pt_class_number, which indicate <a href="#calculation">the quality of public transport</a>.</div>

## 4. Technical details

### Scientific Background

The quality and frequency of transit services is a **decisive** indicator in public transport and spatial planning. It can be used to highlight deficits in the public transport offer and to identify well-serviced locations as attractive areas for development. The approach of Public Transport Quality Classes <i>(German: ÖV-Güteklassen)</i> is **methodologically superior** compared to common catchment areas. In 2011, the [Swiss Federal Office for Spatial Development (ARE)](https://www.are.admin.ch/are/de/home.html) started to use the indicator of <i>ÖV-Güteklassen</i> to include the **attractiveness of public transport services** in the assessment of development quality; since then, these have been considered an important instrument in formal planning processes in Switzerland. In addition, the Swiss model served as an inspiration for application in Austria (e.g. Voralberg) and finds first application in Germany (e.g. by [KCW](https://plan4better.de/en/references/g%C3%BCteklassen-deutschland/) and [Agora Verkehrswende](https://plan4better.de/en/references/agora/)).  

The institutionalization of the indicator in German-speaking countries, as well as the comprehensible and at the same time differentiated calculation methodology, are important advantages of the <i>ÖV-Güteklassen</i>. 

### Calculation

In the Swiss version of the indicator, the calculation of the quality classes is usually carried out for departures on weekdays between 6 AM and 8 PM. For the use in GOAT, the **calculation period** was made more flexible so that the indicator can be calculated **for any day of the week and time of day**. Furthermore, the indicator was adapted to the conditions in Germany. 

The calculations are carried out based on **GTFS data** (see [Data Basis](../../data/data_basis)). First, the number of departures per public transport mode (train, metro, tram, and bus) is dynamically calculated for each station. The sum of the departures is divided by two to calculate the frequency, to eliminate the outward and return directions. In the next step, the **average frequency** for the selected time interval is calculated. The higher-value service is selected as the **station type** in the case of service by several means of transport. For example, in the case of buses and trains, this is the train. With the help of the table below, as well as the station type and the frequency, the station category can now be determined. 

![Classification of transport stops](/img/toolbox/accessibility_indicators/gueteklassen/classification_stations_en.webp "Classification of transport stops")

Subsequently, **buffers** or **isochrones** of the size shown are calculated for the corresponding station categories. This creates several buffers or isochrones that are merged. For overlapping buffers/isochrones, the higher-quality class is used.

### Visualization

The created buffers/isochrones are visualized around the stations in the corresponding colors to highlight the **quality class** (<span style={{color: "#199741"}}>A</span>-<span style={{color: "#E4696A"}}>F</span>).
