## 1. Explanation

The Public Transport (PT) Trip Count shows the **average number of public transport departures per hour** for a selected **time interval** for each public transport stop on a point layer. The results can be visualized either as a sum of all transport modes or by focusing on one dedicated mode (e.g. bus, tram, metro, rail).

This indicator serves as the foundation for the [ÖV-Güteklassen](./oev_gueteklassen.md), but can also be utilized on its own as a straightforward measure for public transport offer at a **station level**. It gives a summary of a station’s departures during a specific time window and day, providing a valuable overview of the public transport offered in a city. Thus, the indicator is often used in **weak point analyses of local transport plans** (see, among others, [Guideline for Local Transport Planning in Bavaria](https://www.demografie-leitfaden-bayern.de/index.html)).

:::info 
The public transport (PT) trip count is only available in areas where the transport network is integrated into GOAT.

In case you need to perform analysis beyond this geofence, feel free to contact the [Support](https://plan4better.de/en/contact/ "Contact Support") and we will check what is possible.

## 2. Example use cases

- Which stations in the city serve as main hubs?
- Which stations have low service rates in comparison to others?
- How does the public transport quality vary over different times of the week or day?

## 3. How to use the indicator?

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">1</div>
  <div class="content">Click on <code>Toolbox</code> <img src={thematicIcon} alt="toolbox" style={{width: "25px"}}/>. </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">2</div>
  <div class="content">Under the <code>Accessibility Indicators</code> menu, click on <code>PT Trip Count</code>. This opens the settings menu.</div>
</div>


![Menu Overview for Public Transport Trip Count](/img/toolbox/accessibility_indicators/trip_count/overview.png "[Menu Overview for Public Transport Trip Count")


### Calculation Time

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">3</div>
  <div class="content">Select for which <code>Day</code>, <code>Start Time</code>, and <code>End Time</code> you would like to calculate the public transport trip count.</div>
</div>

### Reference Layer

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">4</div>
  <div class="content">Select the <code>Reference Layer</code> that contains the area for which you like to calculate the indicator. This can be any polygon feature layer.</div>
</div>


<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">5</div>
  <div class="content">Click on <code>Run</code>. This starts the calculation of the Public Transport Trip Count for the selected area and time interval.</div>
</div>

:::tip Hint

Depending on the size of the selected area, the calculation might take some minutes. The [status bar](../../workspace/home#status-bar) shows the current progress.

### Results

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">6</div>
  <div class="content">As soon as the calculation process is finished, the resulting layer called <b>"Trip Count Station"</b> will be added to the map.</div>
</div>


![Menu Overview for Public Transport Trip Count](/img/toolbox/accessibility_indicators/trip_count/result.png "[Menu Overview for Public Transport Trip Count")

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">7</div>
  <div class="content">When clicking on a point in the map, you can see the <b>station name</b>, <b>total departure count</b>, and the <b>departure counts per mode</b>.</div>
</div>


<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center'}}>

</div> 


:::tip Hint

If you are interested in one specific mode, e.g. only busses, you can use the [attribute-based styling](../../map/layer_style/attribute_based_styling.md) to adjust the point color based on that desired column.

## 4. Technical details

Similar to the Public Transport Quality Classes <i>(German: ÖV-Güteklassen)</i>, this indicator is calculated based on **GTFS data** (see [Inbuilt Datasets](../../data/data_basis)). Based on the selected day and time window, the average number of departures per hour (regardless of direction) is calculated.
