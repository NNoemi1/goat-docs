# Heatmap - Gravity

A color-coded map to visualize the accessibility of points (such as [POI](../../further_reading/glossary#point-of-interest-poi "What is a POI?")) from surrounding areas.

## 1. Explanation

Visualized as a color-coded hexagonal grid, the heatmap takes into account real-world transport and street networks to compute accessibility. After specifying a *routing type* (Walk, Bicycle, etc.), *opportunity layer* and *travel time limit*, the result will display a color-coded hexagonal grid for all areas accessible under these conditions. The color scale refers to local accessibility.

:::info INFO

An `Opportunity layer` contains [geographic point](../../../data/data_types "What are geographic points?") data. Select one or more such layers containing your destination points (opportunities) as input to the heatmap.

:::

Unique to the gravity-based heatmap, customizable properties such as *sensitivity*, the *impedance function* and *destination potential* give you minute control over the method used and metadata taken into account while computing the accessibility value for an area. Influenced by these properties, the accessibility of a point can model complex real-world human behavior and is a powerful measure for transport and accessibility planning.

:::tip Pro tip

Described shortly, accessibility heatmaps are a visualization representing *access* from various unspecified origins, to one or more specified destinations. This is in contrast to catchment areas which represent *egress* from one or more specified origins to various unspecified destinations.

## 2. Example use cases

 - Which neighborhoods or areas have limited access to public amenities, such as parks, recreational facilities, or cultural institutions, and may require targeted interventions to improve accessibility?

 - Are there areas with high potential for transit-oriented development or opportunities for improving non-motorized transportation infrastructure, such as bike lanes or pedestrian-friendly streets?

 - What is the impact of a new amenity on local accessibility?

 - Is there potential to expand the availability of services such as bike sharing or car sharing stations?

 - How does the accessibility in various neighborhoods compare when taking into account the qualitative aspects of amenities (such as frequency of service at bus stops, size of supermarkets, capacity of schools, etc)?

 - What is the real-world accessibility of public transport stations when travel times to these stations impact their accessibility in a non-linear way?

### Configuration

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">4</div>
  <div class="content">Pick the <code>Impedance Function</code> you would like to use for the heatmap.</div>
</div>

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="gaussian" label="Gaussian" default className="tabItemBox">

This function calculates accessibilities based on a Gaussian curve, which is influenced by the `sensitivity` and `destination_potential` you define. For a more in-depth understanding, refer to the [Technical details](./gravity#4-technical-details) section.

:::tip Pro tip

As studies have shown, the relationship between travel time and accessibility is often non-linear. This means that people may be willing to travel a short distance to reach an amenity, but as the distance increases, their willingness to travel rapidly decreases (often disproportionately).

Leveraging the *sensitivity* you define, the Gaussian function allows you to model this aspect of real-world behaviour more accurately.

### Opportunities

Opportunities are essentially point-based data (such as [POI](../../further_reading/glossary#point-of-interest-poi "What is a POI?")) for which you would like to compute a heatmap. These are the "destinations" (such as transit stations, schools, other amenities, or your own custom point-based data) while surrounding areas are "origins" for which an accessibility value will be computed and visualized.

Additionally, you may create more opportunities via the `+ Add Opportunity` button at the bottom of the drawer. All opportunity layers will be combined to produce a unified heatmap.

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">5</div>
  <div class="content">Select your <code>Opportunity Layer</code> from the drop-down menu. This can be any previously created layer containing point-based data.</div>

  <div class="content">If required, choose a <code>Destination Potential Field</code>. This must be a numeric field from your <i>Opportunity Layer</i> which will be used as a coefficient by the accessibility function.</div>
</div>

:::tip Pro-tip

*Destination potential* is a useful way to prioritize certain opportunities over others. For example, if there are two supermarkets and one is nearer than the other, it would typically receive a higher accessibility score due to its proximity. However, if the supermarket farther away is larger, you may want to give it a higher level of importance. *Destination potential* allows you to use an additional property (such as the size of supermarkets) to assign opportunities a "potential" and employ qualitative information while computing accessibility.

## 4. Technical details

### Calculation
The accessibility value of each hexagonal cell within a heatmap is calculated with the help of gravity-based measures and can be operationalized as:

*Accessibility Formula:*

<MathJax.Provider>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '20px', fontSize: '24px'  }}>
    <MathJax.Node formula={"A_i=\\sum_j O_jf(t_{i,j})"} />
  </div>
</MathJax.Provider>


where the accessibility **A** of origin **i** is the sum of all opportunities **O** available at destinations **j** weighted by some function of the travel time **tij** between **i** and **j**. The function **f(tij)** is the impedance function, which can be `gaussian`, `linear`, `exponential`, or `power`. The *sensitivity* parameter **Œ≤** and the *destination potential* are used to adjust the accessibility value.

#### GOAT uses the following formulas for its impedance functions:

*Modified Gaussian, (Kwan,1998):*

<MathJax.Provider>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '20px', fontSize: '24px'  }}>
    <MathJax.Node formula={"f(t_{i,j})=\\exp^{(-t_{i,j}^2/\\beta)}"} />
  </div>
</MathJax.Provider>

*Cumulative Opportunities Linear, (Kwan,1998):*
<div>
<MathJax.Provider>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '20px', fontSize: '24px' }}>
    <MathJax.Node formula={`
      f(t_{ij}) =
      \\begin{cases}
        1 - \\frac{t_{ij}}{\\bar{t}} & \\text{for } t_{ij} \\leq \\bar{t} \\\\
        0 & \\text{otherwise}
      \\end{cases}
    `} />
  </div>
</MathJax.Provider>
  </div>    

  *Negative Exponential, (Kwan,1998):*


<div><MathJax.Provider>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '20px', fontSize: '24px'  }}>
    <MathJax.Node formula={"f(t_{i,j})=\\exp^{(-\\beta t_{i,j})}"} />
  </div>
</MathJax.Provider>
    </div>  

*Inverse Power, (Kwan,1998):*

<div>
<MathJax.Provider>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '20px', fontSize: '24px' }}>
    <MathJax.Node formula={`f(t_{ij}) = \\begin{cases}
      \\ 1 & \\text{for } t_{ij} \\leq 1 \\\\
      t_{i,j}^{-\\beta} & \\text{otherwise}
    \\end{cases}`} />
  </div>
</MathJax.Provider>
</div>  

Travel times are measured in minutes. For a maximum travel time of 30 minutes, destinations that are farther than 30 minutes are considered non-accessible and therefore not considered in the calculation of the accessibility.
The *sensitivity* parameter determines how accessibility changes with increasing travel time. As the *sensitivity* parameter is decisive when measuring accessibility, GOAT allows you to adjust this. The following graphs show the influence of the *sensitivity* parameter on accessibility:

Examples of this functionality will be online soon. üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

:::

Similarly, the *destination potential* can be changed. Thus, for example, one POI type (e.g. hypermarkets) can be assigned a higher accessibility effect than other POI types (e.g. discount supermarkets). The following images show the influence of the *destination potential* parameter on accessibility:

### Classification
In order to classify the accessibility levels that were computed for each grid cell (for color-coded visualization), a classification based on quantiles is used by default. However, various other classification methods may be used instead. Read more in the **[Data Classification Methods](../../map/layer_style/attribute_based_styling#data-classification-methods)** section of the *Attribute-based Styling* page.

### Visualization 

Heatmaps in GOAT utilize **[Uber's H3 grid-based](../further_reading/glossary#h3-grid)** solution for efficient computation and easy-to-understand visualization. Behind the scenes, a pre-computed travel time matrix for each *routing type* utilizes this solution and is queried and further processed in real-time to compute accessibility and produce a final heatmap.

The resolution and dimensions of the hexagonal grid used depend on the selected *routing type*:

#### Walk
- Resolution: 10
- Average hexagon area: 11285.6 m¬≤
- Average hexagon edge length: 65.9 m

#### Bicycle
- Resolution: 9
- Average hexagon area: 78999.4 m¬≤
- Average hexagon edge length: 174.4 m

#### Pedelec
- Resolution: 9
- Average hexagon area: 78999.4 m¬≤
- Average hexagon edge length: 174.4 m

#### Car
- Resolution: 8
- Average hexagon area: 552995.7 m¬≤
- Average hexagon edge length: 461.4 m

### Example of calculation
#### Calculation travel times
The following example illustrates how the local accessibility heatmap is computed. The travel times are calculated for each grid cell to the concerning destination on the street network.

For the hexagon shown here, the calculation yields the following results, depending on the sensitivity parameter:

##### Uniform sensitivity parameter:

:::

##### Varying sensitivity parameter for Hypermarket:
:::info coming soon

Examples of this functionality will be online soon. üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

:::

Applied in GOAT, the following differences arise:

#### Calculation with uniform sensitivity parameter
In the first example, the accessibility for grocery shops in 15 min is calculated using a uniform sensitivity parameter (Œ≤=300,000) for all shops. The result looks like this:

:::info coming soon

Examples of this functionality will be online soon. üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

:::

#### Calculation with different sensitivity parameters
In the second example, the accessibility of grocery shops in 15 min is performed using different sensitivity parameters (Œ≤=300,000 and Œ≤=400,000). This means that the sensitivity parameter depends on the different grocery shop types. For this example, we used Œ≤=400,000 for hypermarkets and Œ≤=300,000 for discounters and supermarkets. This gives the following result:

:::info coming soon

Examples of this functionality will be online soon. üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

:::

By comparing the two results, you can get a sense of the impact *sensitivity* has on accessibility.
